## 🎯 Introduction
Modern consumers expect tailored experiences that align with their unique preferences, lifestyle, and financial goals. To meet this demand, we developed a Generative AI-powered solution designed to revolutionize hyper-personalization in customer engagement. Our solution leverages machine learning techniques to analyze a wide range of data points, including customer demographics, sentiment data, financial data, and purchase history. By combining these insights, the system intelligently identifies patterns, behaviors, and preferences to deliver highly personalized recommendations for financial products and services. By understanding customer needs more effectively, organizations can improve marketing campaigns, optimize product positioning, and tailor communication for maximum impact.

## 💡 Inspiration
The inspiration for this project stems from the growing demand for personalized financial experiences that cater to individual preferences and behaviors. With digital banking on the rise and customers expecting tailored insights, leveraging AI-driven recommendations can enhance financial decision-making, boost engagement, and promote financial well-being.

## ⚙️ What It Does
✅ Role-Based Access Control
      Customers & Admins have separate functionalities.

✅ Personalized Financial Recommendations
      Admin receive AI-driven personalized suggestions for loans, investments, and credit management for each customer based on their risk profile.

✅ Risk-Based Customer Segmentation
      Admins can classify customers as low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk using machine learning models.

✅ Insights & Trend Analysis
      Visual dashboards help admins analyze customer behavior for better financial decision-making.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
   🔹 Frontend: ReactJS + Material-UI (Wells Fargo Theme)
   
   🔹 Backend: Python (Flask)
   
   🔹 Database: PostgreSQL
   
   🔹 Authentication: JWT-based secure login/signup
   
   🔹 Machine Learning Models:
   
         Large Language Model-LLM
         
         Linear Regression - LR 
         
         K-Means
         
         XGBoost (Optimized recommendations)
         
   🔹 Hyperparameter Tuning for better accuracy
## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
Financial data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, requiring extensive preprocessing to ensure data integrity.
Encouraging users to trust and rely on AI-driven financial insights requires a transparent, user-centric design with demonstrable value.
Customer preferences, financial products, and market dynamics change rapidly. Ensuring the model remains up-to-date through continuous learning pipelines is crucial for sustained performance.
Striking a balance between enhancing customer engagement and achieving organizational goals, such as cross-selling or upselling, requires thoughtful strategy.
