## 🎯 Introduction
Customers of today need highly customised experiences that take into account their individual tastes. We created a Generative Al-powered solution that analyses demographic information, sentiment data, purchasing history, and consumer profiles to improve hyper-personalization. This project creates a system that offers organisations actionable insights to maximise client engagement while simultaneously producing personalised suggestions for goods, services, or content.
